## Issues

1.  Support more languages
    1.  Java, Go, C++, ...
        1.  Requirements
            1.  MIT or similar
            2.  Can be downloaded from NPM :)
2.  Tests
    1.  Add coverage tests
    2.  Write more tests for parsers/dumpers/etc
3.  Refactoring
    1.  parser should return EnumFile in parse instead of null and remove EnumFile from ctor
    2.  Yargs tester should parser as api and not an external process
    3.  Use A better logging library
